excerpt: Web & app development at Metaswitch Networks, Softwire. Content Intern at Failbetter Games
order: 2
---
I have done two software engineering internships at Metaswitch Networks (2016) and Softwire (2017), both lasting 9-10 weeks. I also did two short internships in non-software roles at Failbetter Games and Inside the Box Board Games, both in 2017 and lasting 1-2 weeks. 

## Softwire (2017)
I worked in a team of interns to develop a mobile app that helps users with mental health issues and spending addiction. The app would, with the user's consent, monitor their bank transactions and social media, and alert their carer if it detected abnormal behaviour.

We used agile, test-driven development. During this project we used technologies such as Ionic to build the app, Typescript with Angular 4 and Express.js, HTML/CSS, and Python. 

My tasks included: 
-	Integrating with a sparsely-documented API to retrieve bank transactions 
-	User registration and authentication with JWTs, & securing our API routes
-	Writing a recurrent process script in Python for continuous monitoring
-   Implementing mobile-specific functions such as notifications and local storage for iOS / Android
-	Successfully mentoring another intern who had no prior programming experience

## Metaswitch Networks (2016)
I worked on the Support team developing websites for both client and internal use. I learned many languages from scratch: HTML/CSS/Js with Angular, SQL, and Python. I worked on several different projects, the most significant being the design & implementation of efficient data-driven filters in SQL.

In my [leaving review]({{site.url}}/assets/pdfs/Metaswitch REVIEW.pdf) I was praised for delivering **“over twice”** the amount of expected work, grasping new technologies "rapidly" and **completing projects "well ahead of time"**.

## Failbetter Games (2017)
I worked as a Content Intern on Failbetter's browser narrative game Fallen London. My tasks were fairly varied and included QA, cleaning up the database, and researching Victorian entertainment.

## Inside the Box (2017)
I worked as a Research Intern as part of a large intern team helping to develop the dystopian-themed card game 'Newspeak'. We playtested the game and prepared a research document on 'dystopia' to assist in the design and development of the game.

## King Diversi Scholarship to GDC 2016
I was chosen as one of 10 women students in Europe to receive a scholarship from King & Diversi to attend GDC 2016. It was a wonderful experience and solidified my desire to become a gamedev =)
