I worked in a group to create a website that detects and maps trending hashtags on Twitter. The immediacy of the website made it potentially useful for social media managers, marketers, or even for emergency services: it picked up on a hurricane, hours before the hurricane hashtag was shown as trending on Twitter. It also allowed the user to scroll back in time to see the growth of hashtags, their geographical spread based on Twitter location-tagging, and the degree of connection between different hashtags. 

I worked on the front-end writing HTML/CSS/Js, and also took on some project management duties such as writing the specification.
