My first time working on a video game: a group project at the 2016 Global Game Jam, making an arcade game in Unity about summoning a demon while dodging neighbourhood obstacles. I contributed on various fronts, programming in Unity on the UI and some of the obstacle interactions, and making sprites, SFX, music, and animations.
